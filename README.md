Welcome to my data preprocessing project!

In this Jupyter Notebook, I have performed various data preprocessing techniques on a given dataset. The goal of this project is to clean and transform the data in order to make it suitable for further analysis or machine learning tasks. Data preprocessing is an essential step in the data science workflow, as it helps to ensure the quality, reliability, and effectiveness of subsequent analyses.

Throughout this notebook, I have utilized a range of preprocessing techniques, including but not limited to:

Data cleaning: handling missing values, removing outliers, and addressing inconsistencies.
Feature encoding: converting categorical variables into numerical representations for modeling purposes.
Feature selection: identifying and selecting relevant features that contribute most to the analysis or prediction.
Handling imbalanced data: addressing class imbalance issues in the dataset.
Data transformation: applying mathematical or statistical transformations to achieve better distributions or relationships.
Each preprocessing step is explained in detail, along with the code implementation and any necessary explanations or justifications. Additionally, I have included visualizations and descriptive statistics to provide insights into the data and the impact of preprocessing techniques.
